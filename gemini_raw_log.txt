   transcriptional activation.
- **R124W (rs137852367)**: Found in the BRCA1 RING domain, which is crucial for ubiquitination. This variant is recurrent in families with breast cancer and is classified as pathogenic by many databases due to its impact on BRCA1 function.
- **R1443G (rs80357670)**: Located in the Helical domain of BRCA1. This variant is often classified as a VUS but some studies suggest it may have a mild impact on function. Its pathogenicity is debated.
- **R1699Q (rs80357870)**: Found in the BRCT domain, which is important for DNA damage response and tumor suppression. This variant is often classified as a VUS, but some functional assays suggest it may affect BRCA1 protein function. More research is needed for definitive classification.

#### Discussion of Pathogenicity Assessment

The determination of pathogenicity for a genetic variant involves a comprehensive evaluation using multiple lines of evidence, as outlined by guidelines from organizations like the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP). Here's how these principles apply to the variants identified:

1.  **Population Frequency (PM2, BA1):**
    *   **A1708E**: This variant has been observed in various population databases with a frequency that is generally too high to be considered pathogenic for a disorder with the penetrance of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome. Its presence in healthy individuals without a strong family history of cancer suggests it is more likely benign or low-risk.
    *   **R124W**: This variant is rare in general population databases, which supports a pathogenic classification.
    *   **R1443G & R1699Q**: These variants are also relatively rare, aligning with the "Very Low Population Frequency" criterion (PM2), which provides moderate evidence for pathogenicity. However, their frequency isn't as low as some definitively pathogenic variants.

2.  **Computational Prediction (PP3, BP4):**
    *   Bioinformatics tools (e.g., SIFT, PolyPhen-2, CADD, REVEL) are used to predict the functional impact of missense variants.
    *   **A1708E**: Many in silico prediction tools classify A1708E as benign or likely benign, providing weak evidence against pathogenicity (BP4).
    *   **R124W**: Most in silico tools predict R124W to be deleterious, supporting its pathogenic classification (PP3).
    *   **R1443G & R1699Q**: Predictions for these variants are often discordant or show borderline deleterious scores, indicating uncertainty and highlighting the need for additional evidence.

3.  **Functional Studies (PS3, BS3):**
    *   In vitro or in vivo assays are crucial for assessing the impact of variants on protein function.
    *   **A1708E**: Functional studies on A1708E often show no significant impact on BRCA1's normal cellular functions (e.g., DNA repair, transcriptional activity), thus providing strong evidence for a benign classification (BS3).
    *   **R124W**: Functional assays confirm that R124W significantly impairs BRCA1's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and its ability to act as a tumor suppressor, providing strong evidence for pathogenicity (PS3).
    *   **R1443G & R1699Q**: Functional data for these variants are often limited or show ambiguous results. Some studies suggest a mild impact, while others show no clear functional impairment. This lack of definitive functional evidence contributes to their VUS classification.

4.  **Segregation and Co-occurrence (PP1, BP1):**
    *   **A1708E**: This variant has been observed to segregate with disease in some families, but not consistently or with strong statistical significance. More importantly, it has been found in healthy individuals or in families without a clear HBOC pattern.
    *   **R124W**: R124W consistently segregates with breast and ovarian cancer in multiple affected families, providing strong evidence for pathogenicity (PP1). It has also been reported to co-occur with known pathogenic variants less frequently than expected for a benign variant, or when it does, the known pathogenic variant better explains the phenotype.
    *   **R1443G & R1699Q**: There is often insufficient segregation data for these variants, or they are sometimes found in individuals without a strong family history, or they co-occur with known pathogenic variants without clear evidence of independent pathogenicity. This makes it difficult to definitively classify them based on family studies.

5.  **De novo Occurrence (PS2, PM6):**
    *   This criterion is less commonly applied to BRCA1 variants due to the late onset and incomplete penetrance of HBOC.

#### Conclusion on Pathogenicity

*   **BRCA1 c.5123C>A (p.A1708E)**: Based on its relatively high population frequency, benign in silico predictions, and lack of significant functional impairment, A1708E is overwhelmingly classified as **Likely Benign** or **Benign**. Its association with cancer in some studies may be coincidental or due to other modifying factors.
*   **BRCA1 c.371G>A (p.R124W)**: With its rarity in the general population, consistent deleterious in silico predictions, and strong evidence of functional disruption and disease segregation, R124W is widely classified as **Pathogenic**.
*   **BRCA1 c.4328G>A (p.R1443G)**: Due to conflicting in silico predictions, limited or ambiguous functional data, and insufficient segregation information, R1443G remains a **Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS)**. More research, especially robust functional assays and large-scale segregation studies, is needed for reclassification.
*   **BRCA1 c.5095C>A (p.R1699Q)**: Similar to R1443G, R1699Q is classified as a **Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS)**. While some functional data hints at a potential impact, it is not conclusive enough to classify it as pathogenic or likely pathogenic.

The varying classifications highlight the complexity of variant interpretation and the ongoing need for robust functional studies and comprehensive clinical data collection to improve the accuracy of genetic diagnoses for hereditary cancer syndromes.

Title: AI venture sacks 4 for party after crash
Summary: Four senior executives at Air India SATS (AISATS) have been asked to resign after a video of an office party in Gurugram went viral, sparking widespread outrage. The video surfaced just days after the devastating Air India flight AI171 crash on June 12, 2025, which killed 259 people and left the nation in mourning. The clip, which featured AISATS Chief Operating Officer Abraham Zachariah and other staff members dancing to loud music, was widely circulated on social media. The timing of the celebration—held shortly after one of India’s deadliest aviation disasters—was widely condemned as tone-deaf and deeply insensitive. Flight AI171, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner en route to London, crashed into a hostel for medical students at Ahmedabad’s BJ Medical College shortly after takeoff. Of the 260 people on board, only one survived.&amp;mdash; TheSquind (@TheSquind)  As grieving families awaited the repatriation of victims' remains, the video drew sharp criticism for its perceived lack of empathy. Many users on social media slammed the company for insensitivity and poor judgment. In response, AISATS issued a statement saying, “At AISATS, we stand in solidarity with the families affected by the tragic loss of AI171 and deeply regret the lapse in judgment reflected in a recent internal video. The behaviour does not align with our values, and firm disciplinary action has been taken against those responsible as we reaffirm our commitment to empathy, professionalism, and accountability.” While AISATS did not specify when the party occurred, sources confirmed that four senior staff members were terminated for their direct involvement in organizing the event. AISATS is a joint venture between Air India, now owned by the Tata Group, and Singapore-based SATS Ltd., a global leader in airport services. The company emphasized that disciplinary action had been taken to uphold its ethical standards, but the damage to its public image amid a national tragedy has already drawn significant backlash.

[ARTICLE 4]
Title: Office realty leasing rises 30%, on track to beat last year high
Summary: Mumbai: Robust demand for office spaces has pushed commercial property leasing in the first three quarters of 2019 by 30% from a year ago, taking it closer to entire 2018’s performance and making sure that this year surpasses the peak touched last year.Driven by tech corporates — accounting for about a third of the leasing activity — office space take-up touched 47 million sq ft in the first nine months against entire 2018’s performance of 48.9 million sq ft, showed data from CBRE South Asia. With this, office leasing activity is now expected to touch its highest level ever, estimated to be over 60 million sq ft in 2019.Leasing activity stood at about 15.4 million sq ft during the quarter ended September, rising by nearly 23% on an annual basis. This was dominated by small- to medium-sized transactions. Small-sized transactions of less than 10,000 sq ft accounted for over 40% of the transaction activity in the quarter.
  
  
  
  71641558









“With office leasing scaling a historic high in 2019, we expect further strengthening of occupier sentiment in the medium to long term, backed by corporates looking to expand or consolidate their operations. Favourable government initiatives, transparency in the real estate sector and the right reforms will improve investor sentiment greatly in the coming quarters,” said Anshuman Magazine, CEO, India, South-east Asia, Middle East and Africa, CBRE.Like last year, he expects occupiers would put in greater efforts to incorporate flexibility in their portfolios due to changes in the business environment. Occupiers continued to futureproof their portfolios and hedge against future rental escalations by pre-leasing space across various cities.Bengaluru, followed by Hyderabad, dominated large-sized deal closures, while a few large deals were also reported in the NCR and Pune as well. Large-scale deal closures were mostly dominated by tech firms and flexible space operators. Firms belonging to sectors such as research, consulting &amp; analytics, banking, financial services &amp; insurance (BFSI), and engineering &amp; manufacturing also closed large-sized deals.Tech corporates led the office space take-up, followed by research, consulting &amp; analytics companies (19%) and flexible space operators (15%). The rise in the share of flexible space operators (10% in the second quarter of 2019) was primarily a result of their continued expansion across almost all cities.“The share of the tech sector rose from 31% to 40% annually during 2019 year-to-date, which implies that a rise in technology alternatives, insourcing / job preservation in the US and a global slowdown have not had any specific impact on India’s position as a preferred outsourcing destination for both high-skilled and low-skilled tech services, research and development,” said Ram Chandnani, managing director, advisory &amp; transaction services, India, CBRE South Asia.Supply addition rose by more than 80% in 2019 YTD on an annual basis, with about 43.5 million sq. ft. of development completions reported.Four cities — Hyderabad, Bengaluru, NCR and Mumbai — accounted for almost 80% of this supply addition.Compared to the first three quarters in 2018, the share of SEZs in supply dipped from 40% to 27% during 2019 YTD. Supply addition in the quarter also rose by about 6% on a quarterly basis, touching about 15 million sq. ft. More than 70% of this supply was driven by Hyderabad and NCR, followed by Bengaluru.

Title: Developers may face liquidity crisis on NBFC woes: Fitch
Summary: MUMBAI: Liquidity risk is increasing for Indian-based real-estate developers, as non-bank financial institutions (NBFI; including housing finance companies) are shying away from lending to the sector, said Fitch Ratings.Developers that rely on refinancing from NBFIs, particularly those with weak financial profiles, will be affected the most should conditions persist. The availability of unencumbered assets among large developers may be of limited use, as NBFIs are looking to shed their already-high exposure to the sector, especially to large borrowers.NBFIs have disproportionately increased their share of real-estate sector credit in the previous few years, owing to heightened risk aversion by banks; banks have been cutting exposure due to their own funding challenges that began in late 2018, which have become more acute in the previous few months; domestic bank exposures fell to 2.3% of loans in the financial year ending March 2019 from 2.8% in 2015-16.NBFIs are now also shying away from refinancing maturing debt of even large, proven developers to limit concentration risk to the sector. This is pushing developers towards alternative funding channels, such as private equity. The availability of such funding could be more limited than the value of maturing debt and may only be available to established developers with sufficient unpledged assets. It would also come at a higher cost. We believe banks may still consider exposure to quality real estate, but overall exposure continues to decline.Developers that are focused on high-end projects may face higher risk, as sales of such projects have slowed in the last two years. We believe these developers would be wary of taking sharp price corrections on unsold inventory to boost sales, except in extreme circumstances, as this could diminish the value of unsold inventory and weaken collateral cover for existing lenders.In addition, any boost in sales would be temporary. Meanwhile, developers with substantial exposure to affordable housing may still benefit from marginal access to lenders in light of healthy pre-sales growth, supported by India's substantial housing deficit and government incentives for buyers via the credit-linked subsidy scheme as well as for developers, including tax deductions and grant of infrastructure status, which entitles companies to some benefits and concessions.The government has announced measures to improve NBFI-sector liquidity, but their efficacy remains to be seen. For example, we believe the government's July 2019 announcement to provide a first-loss guarantee of 10% on securitised assets issued by NBFIs to banks could ease funding pressure for NBFIs in the short term. However, the provision refers only to financially sound issuers and there is a lack of clarity about the duration of the guarantee and the definition of what comprises a 'financially sound' entity. In addition, most of the actions by the authorities to alleviate the liquidity squeeze will benefit the largest and least risky NBFIs and is unlikely to address the pressure on the more property focused players.Defaults by two NBFIs - Infrastructure Leasing &amp; Financial Services Ltd (IL&amp;FS) in September 2018 and Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) in June 2019 - have contributed to the sector-wide liquidity squeeze, as investors have become more risk averse. Banks' low appetite for lending to real-estate developers is evidenced by the usually high risk weights attached to such loans. These are due to developers' typically low credit ratings amid high leverage, making exposure to the sector an inefficient use of banks' already-limited capital.Substantial bank recapitalisation to increase lending capacity could benefit NBFIs as well as real-estate developers, subject to the banks' risk appetite. Although a structural improvement in NBFI asset books would take time. Nonetheless, even under better conditions we expect NBFI's to tighten credit standards, with developers facing funding pressure until there is a broader improvement in their operations, with better end-user demand and pricing support.

Title: Adani Green to seek board nod to raise up to $1 billion
Summary: Adani Green Energy is set to seek board approval to raise Rs 6,150 crore ($750 million) to Rs 8,200 crore ($1 billion) through the qualified institutional placement (QIP) route, said people aware of the matter.Two group companies had got approval of their boards for fundraising on May 13 —Adani Enterprises (Rs 12,500 crore) and Adani Transmission (Rs 8,500 crore).The exercise is part of a group plan outlined internally last year to build a “three-year equity cushion” to support expansion plans.Adani Green has secured such capital-raising permission every year from its board except in 2021, as per a Bloomberg analysis.The capital raised by Adani Green Energy will be used to repay an outstanding $750 million, three-year bond issued in 2021 that’s due next year. The money is likely to be kept in a dedicated redemption reserve account and paid on the due date, said the people cited above.Renegotiating Terms With TotalThe original plan had been to prepay the bond after special Reserve Bank of India (RBI) approval but the company decided against this move.“We do not comment on routine business matters. All public disclosures on business matters are disclosed when appropriate,” an Adani Group spokesperson told ET.Adani Green is also renegotiating the terms of its agreement with French utilities giant TotalEnergies for a proposed $4 billion investment in a green hydrogen venture, having signed a memorandum of understanding in 2022. In February, Total said it was pausing the plan in the wake of the Hindenburg Research report on the Adani Group alleging stock manipulation and fraud. The Adani Group has rejected the report’s findings.Total had said it won’t immediately proceed with the plan that involved taking a 25% stake in Adani New Industries Ltd (ANIL), a subsidiary of Adani Enterprises.In June last year, ANIL and TotalEnergies had outlined a capex plan of $50 billion to set up a 2.5 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa) of green hydrogen manufacturing capacity over the next 10 years, with the first phase of 1 mmtpa expected to be commissioned before 2030. Total had also made a total $10 billion capital commitment to the hydrogen venture, standing guarantor to 50% of the project’s debt, translating to $6 billion, ET had reported February 13.ANIL plans to manufacture green hydrogen and downstream products such as ammonia, urea, methanol and ethanol at its Khavda and Mundra SEZ facilities. The Khavda site has a land bank of 71,000 acres, which has a large-scale renewable deployment potential of 20 GW due to its high wind and solar resource potential.After the initial MoU, a more detailed ‘heads of agreement’ — pre-contractual negotiations for a commercial framework — was originally planned to be signed between May and September this year. But this is unlikely at this juncture.The Adani Group has, however, continued with the project work in Mundra on its own, aiming to complete a substantial part of the first phase of the integrated manufacturing ecosystem for ANIL by December.This involves 4.5 GW of solar module manufacturing capacity and 1.5 GW of wind turbine manufacturing capacity along with electrolysers, glass, aluminium frames etc. Analysts say over 5% of the total capex has already been incurred by Adani though the bulk of the work is scheduled for 2026-2028. Any binding agreement with Total is now expected only in 2024 or 2025 and the valuation and the overall commercial terms is likely to get altered as the French company is not incurring any of the greenfield project risks, they said.“We have 40 GW of land equivalent. We've been doing solar modules for the past five years. We know we will produce modules at 15 cents to 17 cents,” Robbie Singh, chief financial officer of Adani Enterprises, had told ET on January 22.Other than the green hydrogen project, Total has just over $3 billion of investments with Adani, including in gas distribution and solar projects, which it has played down as a small 2.4% slice of its total capital commitments.

Title: At Rs 10,000 crore, Anil Ambani's Reliance Capital recovery may be only 43%
Summary: Lenders to Anil Ambani-promoted Reliance Capital are likely to recover just about ₹10,000 crore after the winning bidder, Hinduja Group, declined to significantly improve its offer in the last round of bilateral negotiations that ended on Monday evening, people aware of the development told ET. The recovery, totalling about ₹10,090 crore on factoring in the target company's cash balances and the Hinduja offer, falls short of the ₹12,500-13,000 crore estimated liquidation value. A Hinduja Group entity, IndusInd International Holdings, offered ₹9,650 crore in the extended auction held on April 26. Hinduja improved the offer by only ₹10 crore during the bilateral negotiations, the people cited above said. In addition, the distressed financial services company has around Rs 430 crore as cash balances, which would be distributed among the lenders. This would add up to Rs 10,090 crore, equating to a 43% recovery for verified lenders.Administrator Nageswara Rao Y has admitted Rs 23,666 crore in claims from verified creditors."Hinduja Group will submit a detailed resolution plan by next week while lenders are in the process of finalising distribution of the proceeds," one of the persons cited above said. After this, the administrator will invite lenders to vote on the eligible plans.However, resolution of Reliance Capital will be subject to approval from the Supreme Court, which is scheduled to hear in August the auction-related dispute between Torrent Investments, a bidder also in the fray in the earlier rounds.  100459497Crucial LIC, EPFO RolesThe stand by LIC, the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) and JC Flowers Asset Reconstruction Co on approving the plan will be critical since they are majority debtholders. Yes Bank, an original Reliance Capital lender, sold its debt to JC Flowers ARC. A resolution plan can be approved only if 66% of creditors vote in its favour.Separately, Credit Suisse-led bondholders have decided not to contest a decision by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which directed them to return the custody of Reliance General Insurance shares to the administrator, said the people cited above.This has come as a major relief to the lenders that were worried the resolution might be delayed if Credit Suisse-led bondholders appealed against the tribunal's order.In 2018, Credit Suisse-led investors invested in bonds issued by Reliance Home Finance, a Reliance Capital unit. The home finance company failed to honour the payment on the due date.

Title: US SEC yet to serve legal documents to Gautam Adani, his nephew in alleged $265 million bribery case
Summary: The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed a status update with a federal court in New York, detailing its ongoing efforts to serve legal documents to billionaire Gautam Adani and his nephew Sagar in connection with a civil securities case filed last year.In a June 27 letter submitted to Magistrate Judge James R Cho of the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY), the SEC said it is continuing to pursue formal service of the summons and complaint under the provisions of the Hague Service Convention.The defendants, who are based in India, are yet to be officially served.US SEC has to serve the summons to Adani Group founder and chairman Gautam Adani and his nephew Sagar in the alleged USD 265 million payoffs to win lucrative renewable power supply contracts, through proper diplomatic channels as it has no jurisdiction to summon a foreign national directly.The SEC originally filed the complaint on November 20, 2024, alleging that two violated US securities laws by making false and misleading statements related to a September 2021 bond offering by Adani Green Energy Ltd.According to the SEC, Rule 4 (f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs service in foreign jurisdictions and permits the use of international treaties, such as the Hague Convention. The rule does not impose a specific time limit for service, provided reasonable efforts are being made.

Title: Apple faces Indian engineer’s bias lawsuit
Summary: Apple Inc. lost an early round in a discrimination lawsuit brought in the U.S. by a female engineer from India who says her two managers -- one from her country, the other from Pakistan -- treated her as they would in their own countries: as a subservient.The woman’s case in California state court is the latest to allege workplace bias in Silicon Valley that focuses on cultural prejudices of some tech workers from South Asia. Cisco Systems Inc. is fighting a suit brought by California’s civil rights agency alleging bias against a member of India’s so-called lower castes, known as Dalits.Anita Nariani Schulze is part of the Sindhi minority -- she is Hindu, with ancestry in the Sindh region of what is now Pakistan. Her complaint alleges that her senior and direct managers, both male, consistently excluded her from meetings while inviting her male counterparts, criticized her, micromanaged her work, and deprived her of bonuses, despite positive performance evaluations and significant team contributions.Schulze claims the managers’ animus reflects sexism, racism, religious bias and discrimination on the basis of national origin. The Sindhi Hindu nationality is “known for its technical acumen” and its gender equality, she says, which “exacerbated the managers’ discriminatory treatment.”In a tentative ruling on Wednesday, Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Sunil R. Kulkarni rejected Apple’s request to toss out the suit. While not ruling on the merits of the case, Kulkarni said Schulze had adequately supported her legal claims. Apple had argued her claims weren’t specific enough and were based on stereotypes.But the judge rejected Schulze’s request to represent a class of female Apple employees who suffered job discrimination over the last four years. He agreed with Apple that she didn’t show a pattern of discrimination that could be applied to a broader group.It wasn’t clear from the court’s docket whether the judge will hold a hearing Thursday before issuing a final ruling.Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.In the Cisco case, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing alleged that two Indian employees at the San Jose-based company discriminated against a Dalit co-worker on the basis of caste.Cisco has denied the claims, insisting it has “zero tolerance for discrimination.” It also said the lawsuit should be tossed out because caste isn’t a protected category under U.S. civil rights law.

Title: Delhi govt to recruit 15,000 more home guard personnel: LG
Summary: New Delhi: The Delhi government will recruit 15,000 home guards, taking their total number to 25,000, an official statement said on Wednesday.  Delhi LG VK Saxena on Tuesday distributed letters of enrolment to 1669 home guards out of 10,000, for which the recruitment process was started in January, said the statement from the Raj Niwas.  Addressing the newly recruited home guards at an event, the LG said that in the near future additional 15,000 home guards will be added, taking their total strength to over 25,000 it said.  The newly recruited home guards included 226 former civil defence volunteers (CDVs) who were working as bus marshals when they were removed in November last year. The new recruits also included 181 women, the statement said.  The LG in January this year cleared enrolment of 10,285 home guards and directed that the CDVs be given preference in the form of extra credit points in the selection process. However, some candidates approached the court, and as a result, the appointment on 7,939 posts of home guards was kept pending as the matter became sub-judice. The LG, had however, directed appointment of 2,346 home guards who qualified physical measurement and efficiency, and written tests. Out of 2,346 posts, 1669 cleared the medical test and were handed over their appointment letters. In response to the advertisement for 10,285 vacancies, total 1.09 lakh applications were received but only 32,511 reported for the physical test. Meanwhile, the some applicants moved the high court over various issues and a status quo was ordered by the court. The LG has also directed the director general (home guards) to ensure that the remaining 7,939 vacancies are also filled up at the earliest after taking cognizance of the court matters, added the statement.

\section{Introduction}

Enterobacteriaceae is a diverse family of bacteria, including important human pathogens such as <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Salmonella</i>, and <i>Shigella</i> [1]. While <i>Escherichia coli</i> is a common inhabitant of the human gastrointestinal tract, certain strains can cause severe diseases, including urinary tract infections, diarrhea, and meningitis [2]. On the other hand, <i>Shigella</i> species are obligate human pathogens responsible for shigellosis, a severe diarrheal disease characterized by fever, abdominal cramps, and bloody diarrhea [3].

Accurate identification of bacterial species is crucial for appropriate treatment and epidemiological surveillance. Traditionally, bacterial identification relies on phenotypic methods, such as biochemical tests and automated systems like VITEK 2 Compact [4]. While these methods are widely used, their discriminatory power may be limited, particularly for closely related species within the same family, such as <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Shigella</i> [5].

Molecular methods, such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR, have emerged as powerful tools for bacterial identification and typing [6-8]. 16S rRNA gene sequencing is considered the gold standard for bacterial identification due to its high resolution and reliability [9]. PFGE and ERIC-PCR, while primarily used for molecular typing, can also provide valuable insights into bacterial relationships and aid in species differentiation [10, 11].

In this study, we investigated the genetic relationships between <i>Shigella flexneri</i> isolates from clinical samples using PFGE and ERIC-PCR. Interestingly, two isolates identified as <i>Shigella flexneri</i> by conventional methods showed discordant results with molecular methods. This prompted a detailed investigation using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, which revealed a misidentification. This case highlights the importance of combining various molecular methods for accurate and reliable identification of bacterial species, particularly for closely related pathogens.

\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Bacterial Isolates}

A total of 10 bacterial isolates identified as <i>Shigella flexneri</i> based on biochemical tests and VITEK 2 Compact were obtained from clinical samples. These isolates were cultured on MacConkey agar and stored at -80°C in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth containing 20% glycerol.

\subsection{Genomic DNA Extraction}

Genomic DNA was extracted from bacterial isolates using the GeneJET Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Thermo Scientific, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted DNA was quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) and stored at -20°C until further use.

\subsection{16S rRNA Gene Sequencing}

The 16S rRNA gene was amplified using universal primers 27F (5′-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3′) and 1492R (5′-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′) [12]. PCR amplification was performed in a 50 µL reaction mixture containing 100 ng genomic DNA, 0.5 µM of each primer, 200 µM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1X PCR buffer, and 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific, USA). PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 90 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were purified using the GeneJET PCR Purification Kit (Thermo Scientific, USA) and sequenced by a commercial sequencing service. The obtained sequences were analyzed using the NCBI BLAST tool to identify the bacterial species.

\subsection{Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE)}

PFGE was performed according to the PulseNet protocol for <i>Shigella</i> [13]. Briefly, bacterial cells were embedded in 1% SeaKem Gold agarose (Lonza, USA) plugs and lysed overnight with cell lysis buffer containing proteinase K. The plugs were then washed and digested with XbaI restriction enzyme (Thermo Scientific, USA) at 37°C for 4 h. Electrophoresis was performed in a CHEF-DR III system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA) in 0.5X TBE buffer at 14°C. The pulse times ranged from 2.2 s to 63.8 s for 19 h, with a voltage of 6 V/cm. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light. PFGE patterns were analyzed using BioNumerics software (Applied Maths, Belgium).

\subsection{Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus (ERIC)-PCR}

ERIC-PCR was performed using primers ERIC1R (5′-ATAA GTC TAG GTT GTT CTA TGAA-3′) and ERIC2 (5′-AAG TAA GTG ACT GGG GTG AGC G-3′) [14]. PCR amplification was performed in a 25 µL reaction mixture containing 50 ng genomic DNA, 0.5 µM of each primer, 200 µM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1X PCR buffer, and 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific, USA). PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 52°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 8 min, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized under UV light. ERIC-PCR patterns were analyzed visually.

\section{Results}

Out of the 10 bacterial isolates identified as <i>Shigella flexneri</i> by biochemical tests and VITEK 2 Compact, two isolates (designated Isolate A and Isolate B) showed interesting results with molecular typing methods.

PFGE analysis of the 10 isolates revealed distinct profiles. Interestingly, Isolate A and Isolate B exhibited identical PFGE patterns (Figure 1), suggesting a close genetic relationship between them. This finding was unexpected, as these isolates were obtained from different clinical sources.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{FIGURE1.jpg}
    \caption{PFGE profiles of bacterial isolates digested with XbaI. Lanes: M, Salmonella Braenderup H9812 (molecular weight marker); 1-8, other Shigella flexneri isolates; A, Isolate A; B, Isolate B.}
\end{figure}

Further, ERIC-PCR was performed to assess the genetic diversity of the isolates. While the majority of <i>Shigella flexneri</i> isolates showed similar ERIC-PCR profiles, Isolate A and Isolate B exhibited different ERIC-PCR patterns (Figure 2). This discrepancy between PFGE and ERIC-PCR results prompted us to re-evaluate the identity of these two isolates.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{FIGURE2.jpg}
    \caption{ERIC-PCR profiles of bacterial isolates. Lanes: M, 100 bp DNA ladder; 1-8, other Shigella flexneri isolates; A, Isolate A; B, Isolate B.}
\end{figure}

To confirm the species identification, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed for Isolate A and Isolate B. The obtained 16S rRNA gene sequences were subjected to BLAST analysis against the NCBI database. Surprisingly, both Isolate A and Isolate B showed 99.9% sequence identity to <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains, rather than <i>Shigella flexneri</i>. This finding strongly suggested that these two isolates were misidentified by the conventional biochemical tests and VITEK 2 Compact system.

\section{Discussion}

The accurate identification of bacterial pathogens is paramount for effective patient management, infection control, and epidemiological surveillance. Our study highlights a critical case of bacterial misidentification that could have significant implications. The initial identification of Isolate A and Isolate B as <i>Shigella flexneri</i> by biochemical tests and VITEK 2 Compact was subsequently contradicted by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, which revealed them to be <i>Escherichia coli</i>.

The close genetic relationship between <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Shigella</i> species is well-documented. <i>Shigella</i> is considered a highly evolved clone of <i>E. coli</i> that has acquired virulence plasmids and lost certain metabolic capabilities, leading to its distinct pathogenic lifestyle [15]. This close evolutionary relationship often poses challenges for traditional phenotypic identification methods, which rely on biochemical reactions. VITEK 2 Compact, an automated system, also relies on a panel of biochemical tests and may struggle to differentiate between such closely related species, especially if the biochemical profiles overlap [16].

The discordant results between PFGE and ERIC-PCR for Isolate A and Isolate B further underscore the complexity. While both isolates exhibited identical PFGE profiles, suggesting a clonal relationship, their ERIC-PCR patterns were different. This could be attributed to the inherent differences in the discriminatory power and genomic targets of these two typing methods. PFGE targets large genomic rearrangements and insertions/deletions, providing a macro-restriction profile, while ERIC-PCR targets repetitive intergenic sequences, reflecting more subtle genomic variations [17, 18]. The identical PFGE patterns for these two <i>E. coli</i> isolates suggest they might originate from a common ancestor or a recent clonal expansion, despite their different ERIC-PCR profiles. This emphasizes that while PFGE is often considered highly discriminatory, it may not always capture all genetic variations reflected by other methods like ERIC-PCR, or vice versa.

The definitive identification of Isolate A and Isolate B as <i>Escherichia coli</i> by 16S rRNA gene sequencing highlights the indispensable role of molecular methods, particularly gene sequencing, in bacterial diagnostics. 16S rRNA gene sequencing offers a highly reliable and accurate means of species identification due to the presence of both conserved and variable regions in the gene, allowing for universal amplification and species-specific differentiation [19]. This study reinforces the recommendation that for critical cases or when phenotypic results are ambiguous, molecular confirmation, especially 16S rRNA gene sequencing, should be employed.

Misidentification of pathogens can lead to inappropriate treatment, delayed implementation of infection control measures, and inaccurate epidemiological data. For instance, treating an <i>E. coli</i> infection as shigellosis might lead to unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, contributing to antibiotic resistance, or overlooking the true source of infection. Conversely, misidentifying a virulent <i>Shigella</i> as a less pathogenic <i>E. coli</i> could lead to underestimation of disease severity and delayed appropriate intervention.

In conclusion, our study demonstrates a case of bacterial misidentification between <i>Shigella flexneri</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i> using conventional methods. The discrepancy was resolved by combining different molecular approaches, including PFGE, ERIC-PCR, and critically, 16S rRNA gene sequencing. This research underscores the importance of a multi-faceted approach to bacterial identification, especially for closely related species. Integrating advanced molecular techniques with traditional methods ensures greater accuracy in clinical diagnostics and epidemiological investigations.
